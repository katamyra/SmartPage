# SmartPage

SmartPage is a chrome extension built to make it easier to traverse pages in textbooks and other pdfs.  
Often it can be annoying to try to get to a specific textbook page because the first page of the pdf often
isnt the first page of the textbook.  

With SmartPage, a user can input the first page where the textbook starts numbering pages and then choose
any page to go to and be taken there.
