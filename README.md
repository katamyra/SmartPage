# SmartPage

SmartPage is a chrome extension built to make it easier to traverse pages in textbooks and other pdfs.  
Often it can be annoying to try to get to a specific textbook page because the first page of the pdf often
isnt the first page of the textbook.  

With SmartPage, a user can input the first page where the textbook starts numbering pages and then choose
any page to go to and be taken there.

## How to Install SmartPage?

Since smartpage isnt on the chrome web store, it must be downloaded and added as a developer extension onto your browser.  

First, enable developer mode in extensions. You can do this by going to [Chrome Extensions](chrome://extensions/) and enabling "Developer Mode" in the top right.

Then, clone the repository in your desired path. 

`git clone https://github.com/katamyra/SmartPage.git`

Head back to [Chrome Extensions](chrome://extensions/) and select *Load Unpacked* and choose the SmartPage Folder.

Now, you will see SmartPage in your list of extensions! Pin it and use freely.

## Todo List
1) Remember first page when extension window is closed
2) Check if link is a pdf before changing pages. If not a pdf, open an error popup.
